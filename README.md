## How to fix PC suddenly slow?


These are the solutions to the causes of the PC slowing down. I will show you one by one. You can fix it according to your own situation.


### Manually check for system updates

When you suddenly slow down while using your PC, it may be that Windows has a new version and needs to be updated. Ensuring that your computer has the latest Windows and the latest drive is essential to get the best PC performance. New Windows and drive updates provide performance improvements, and outdated operating systems may cause PC speeds to slow.

You can open the control panel in "Start", then click "Update and Security", in "Windows Update", select the "Check for Updates" to update Windows 10.

### Scan the PC with anti-virus software

If the computer is infected with malware and viruses, it will also slow down the speed of the computer. I suggest you run anti-virus software to scan your computer for viruses, and thoroughly remove viruses that may impair your computer's performance.

### Clean up the dust

The fan on the computer CPU is used to dissipate heat, but due to static electricity, it will attract a lot of dust. If it has not been cleaned for a long time, the air outlet will be blocked by dust and the PC will slow down. You can often clean up the dust to increase the heat dissipation efficiency of the computer. 

### End background program

Slow computer running is usually caused by too many programs running at the same time, which takes up processing power and reduces the performance of the PC. Even if some programs are closed, they will continue to run in the background or start automatically when you start the computer.

To see which background programs are running on your PC and how much memory and processing power they occupy, please open the "Task Manager", which you can access by pressing CTRL + ALT + DELETE.


### Uninstall infrequently used programs

If you did not experience any slowness when using the PC before, but the PC will slow down after downloading the software, it may also be due to the installation of too many programs and the memory space is full. When the memory is full, the PC will run slowly. At this time, it is recommended that you uninstall some infrequently used software to clean up the memory.

You can search for **"Control Panel"** in the search bar in the lower-left corner and then click **"Uninstall a Program"**. Select the software that is not commonly used it to uninstall.

The above has introduced you to five quick ways to solve the PC suddenly slow, but if you want to keep the running speed of the PC continuously, these methods are difficult to meet your needs. You need to use some more advanced methods to make your computer faster.
